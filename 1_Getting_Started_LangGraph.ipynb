other AI models, generative AI learns the underlying patterns and structures within that data and then uses that knowledge to generate new, original outputs. \\n\\nThink of it like this:\\n\\n* **Traditional AI:**  Analyzes a dataset of cat pictures to identify features that make a cat a cat ( pointy ears, whiskers, etc.)\\n* **Generative AI:**  Learns from the cat pictures and can then
